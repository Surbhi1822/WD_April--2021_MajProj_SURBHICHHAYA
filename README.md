# Basic E-Commerce Website (HTML & CSS)

This is a **beginner-level static e-commerce website** built using **HTML and CSS** in 2021.  
It was one of my first projects in web development, made to practice page layout, styling, and building a multi-page site.  

The project simulates a simple online shopping site with product listings and basic navigation, but does not include backend or database functionality.
